The Automap is composed of many different image files depicted as small icons to convey what part of the area level is being displayed. This file will assign these image files to their related map cells, which will properly build the Automap as the player explores the area. Not all tiles will have image files assigned to them, and in these cases, those parts of the Automap will remain blank.<br>Any column field name starting with \"*\" is considered a comment field and is not used by the game.",
