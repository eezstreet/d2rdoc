Mana is calculated in 256ths in code which equals 8 bits. This field acts as a bitwise shift value, which means it will modify the mana value by the power of 2. For example, if this value equals 5 then that means divide the mana value of 256ths by 2^5 = 32 (or multiply the mana by 32/256). A value equal to 8 means 256/256 which means that the mana of 256ths value is not shifted.",
